# TimeSplitters 2 — Native PC Port

**The PS2 classic, recompiled into a real PC game — no emulator. Windows, Linux and Steam Deck.<br>
60 FPS, true 16:9, up to 4K, mouse and keyboard, split-screen, and the online multiplayer the PS2 version never got.**

> **F8 video recording** and an **F7 free camera** for screenshots.

## Play it in 3 minutes

Download the package for your system from [**Releases**](https://github.com/Destinity13/TimeSplitters-2-Native-Linux-Recomp/releases/latest),
extract it, start the launcher and pick **your** disc image. The launcher checks the disc, extracts it and builds the
game once with a progress bar (about 3 minutes on a desktop PC). Then press **Play**.

Nothing to install: each package brings its own compiler and prebuilt libraries, and only the code generated from
your disc is compiled on your PC.

**In the game:** ESC / F1 / Guide = settings menu and server browser · F7 = free camera · F8 = record video · F9 = FPS · F10 = turbo · F11 or Alt+Enter = fullscreen · F12 = screenshot

**Mouse and keyboard:** click into the game to capture the mouse (ESC releases it). Mouse look with the game's own
aim-mode crosshair (pinned to the centre, shots land on it), left = fire, right = zoom (hold), middle/Q = secondary
fire, E/Space = use, R = reload, C = crouch, wheel = weapon, WASD = move. Every key and mouse button can be rebound in
the settings menu while playing; sensitivity, zoom sensitivity and invert are there too. On the Steam Deck mouse
aiming is off by default, and on every system touching the gamepad hands control straight back to it. Mouse play is new
and not finished yet (aim-mode walking speed, vehicles): [what is done and what is open](docs/MOUSE.md).

## Online multiplayer

> [!NOTE]
> New in 1.0. Tested on a LAN so far; the first matches over the internet are what the community list is for – add
> your server with a pull request to [server/servers.txt](server/servers.txt).

The PS2 game had LAN play through the Network Adapter; online play was cut before release. **This port brings it
online.** Everyone on the same **`ts2-server`** meets in *Arcade → Network* as if on one LAN, with all modes, all maps
and up to 16 players.

<img src="docs/screenshots/online_match.jpg" width="100%" alt="First online match: the joining game finds the server, both players in the lobby, Deathmatch on Mexican Mission from both sides">

- **In-game server browser** in the style of the classic PC shooters: server list, players, ping, password, favourites, direct address. It opens by itself at *Arcade → Network*.
- **Host your own server** with one command: `./ts2-server --name "My server"`. It is included in the package and is a single C++ file without dependencies (it also builds on Windows with MSVC). [How to host](server/README.md)
- **One server for every platform:** Linux and Steam Deck players meet on the same `ts2-server`; Windows players join the same servers.
- Nothing in the game is changed: you use the original menus, *Start Game* to host and *Join Game* to join.
- **Your IP stays private:** players only ever talk to the server, never to each other. The server is a dumb relay
  with rate limits and connection caps, and ships with a hardened systemd unit. [Security model](server/README.md#security-model)

## What makes it different

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Native, not emulated** | The game's MIPS code is recompiled into C++ and compiled for your CPU. No CPU emulation at runtime; only graphics and sound come from PCSX2's GS and SPU2. |
| **Online the PS2 never had** | The original LAN mode, carried over the internet by a small relay server, with a real server browser. |
| **One click** | Same game on Windows, Linux and Steam Deck. The launcher does everything; you only bring the disc. |
| **Better than the original, faithful where it counts** | 60 FPS, real 16:9 instead of stretching, 1×–8× resolution, optional fixes (frame blending off, no letterbox). Everything else behaves like the PS2. |
| **Checked against PCSX2** | Every fix is measured against the emulator (savestates, screenshots, register logs) before it lands. [VERIFICATION](docs/VERIFICATION.md) |
| **Open and legal** | GPL-3.0, no game data in the repository, every bug and fix documented. [FINDINGS](docs/FINDINGS.md) |

## FAQ

| | |
|---|---|
| **Does it run on Windows?** | Yes, since 1.0.1: Windows 10 and 11, 64-bit, with Direct3D 11 (Vulkan as fallback). The package brings everything it needs, including the compiler that builds your copy. Windows may warn about an unsigned app the first time – "More info" → "Run anyway". |
| **Do I need PCSX2 installed?** | No. The package brings the small GS/SPU2 bridge it needs. Nothing else is installed on your system. |
| **Which disc works?** | The **USA** release, `SLUS-203.14`, as an `.iso` dump of your own disc. PAL and Japanese discs are different builds and will not work (yet). |
| **Is it an emulator with extra steps?** | No. The game's CPU code is translated to C++ once and compiled for your PC. At runtime there is no MIPS interpreter or JIT, only the GS/SPU2 (graphics and sound) from PCSX2. That is why it holds 60 FPS on a Steam Deck. |
| **Why does it compile on my PC?** | Because the translated game code is derived from your disc and must not be distributed. Your PC turns your disc into your build, once, with the compiler that ships in the package. |
| **Controller, mouse or both?** | Both, at the same time. Gamepads through SDL3 (any modern pad, rumble, pressure buttons), mouse look with the game's own crosshair, all keys and buttons rebindable in the menu. Mouse play is the newest part and [not finished](docs/MOUSE.md). |
| **Can I play with friends?** | With 1.0: online through a `ts2-server` (host your own in one command, up to 16 players), or split-screen on one PC today. |
| **Does it change how the game plays?** | No. The PS2 game logic runs unchanged; the visible differences (60 FPS, 16:9, no ghosting, no letterbox) are switchable, and the Easy/Normal/Hard quirks of the original are all still there. |

**Which TimeSplitters 2 port is this?** As far as we know the only active recompilation of the **PS2** version,
checked frame by frame against PCSX2. [split2-recomp](https://github.com/phobos665/split2-recomp) recompiles the
**Xbox** version instead; both are worth a look.

## How it was built

1. **PCSX2 is the reference, always.** Every scene is first run in PCSX2 with a scripted virtual gamepad; savestates
   at fixed frames give the "truth" for RAM, GS registers and pictures.
2. **The port replays the same inputs headless** and dumps the same things. A difference is a bug; the diff says where.
3. **Fixes go into the recompiler or the runtime, not into the game.** The game's own code stays as it came off the
   disc; every finding is written down ([FINDINGS](docs/FINDINGS.md)), from FPU rounding to a frozen COP0 counter
   that kept the network code silent.
4. **Every build is numbered and tested** (`pc001` … `pc143`): 60 FPS check, all ten story levels, split-screen,
   package setup as a fresh user on Linux, the whole Windows chain under Wine, CI jobs on real Windows and play-tests on a real Windows PC.
5. **Tools were built along the way:** input record/replay, RAM-diff search (that is how the camera and player
   position for mouse look were found), write watches with native backtraces, a hang reporter, frame capture.

A human maintainer sets direction and play-tests on real hardware; an AI coding agent (Claude) does most of the
reverse engineering, implementation and measurement. See [AI disclosure](#ai-disclosure) and
[VERIFICATION](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

```

No CPU emulation at runtime: the game's MIPS code becomes C++ and is compiled for your PC. Only graphics (GS) and
sound (SPU2) come from PCSX2, through a small bridge library. The PS2 network adapter is emulated and connected to a
`ts2-server`, so the game's own LAN code plays online.
